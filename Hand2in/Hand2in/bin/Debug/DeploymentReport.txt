     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[Person].[AdresseID] on table [dbo].[Person] must be added, but the column has no default value and
         does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must
         either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults
         as a deployment option.
       The column [dbo].[Person].[Type] on table [dbo].[Person] must be added, but the column has no default value and does not
         allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue you must either: add
         a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults as a
         deployment option.
       The table [dbo].[Telefon] is being dropped and re-created since all non-computed columns within the table have been
         redefined.
